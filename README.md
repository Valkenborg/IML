Introduction to Machine Learning

Welcome to the landing page of the coursework entitled "Introduction to Machine Learning". This course will build further on the handbook "An Introduction to Statistical Learning with Applications in R" written by Gareth James, Daniela Witten, Trevor Hastie and Robert Tibshirani. The handbook, R code, slides and much more material can be downloaded freely at [http://faculty.marshall.usc.edu/gareth-james/ISL/](http://faculty.marshall.usc.edu/gareth-james/ISL/).

This course will use the handbook as backbone to provide deep-dive content, such as video presentations, jupyter notebooks and some mathematical underpinning to important concepts that were only briefly introduced in the handbook. But before running comes walking. Therefore it is good to revise the material in the handbook by watching the [video lectures](MOOC) of Trevor Hastie and Robert Tibshirani. 

The lab sessions at the end of each session can be viewed as static [webpage](JUPYTER) and Jupyter notebooks are available for download.

The powerpoint presentation for lecturing and workshops can be found [overhere](PP).
