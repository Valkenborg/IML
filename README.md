Introduction to Machine Learning

Welcome the landing page of the coursework entitled "Introduction to Machine Learning". This course will build further on the handbook "An Introduction to Statistical Learning with Applications in R" writen by Gareth James, Daniela Witten, Trevor Hastie and Robert Tibshirani. The handbook and much more material can be downloaded freely at http://faculty.marshall.usc.edu/gareth-james/ISL/.

This course will provide deep-dive content, such as video sessions, jupiter notebooks and some mathematical proofs to further explore that important concepts that were only briefly introduced in their handbook. But before runing comes walking. Therefore it is good to revise the material in the handbook by watching the [video lectures](MOOC) of Trevor Hastie and Robert Tibshirani.
